# TEI CAT

The TEI Critical Apparatus Toolbox is an online application for people preparing a critical edition in TEI XML. It allows you to display, your edition in various forms, and to perform quality checks on your encoding. It also includes a section dedicated to the annotation of images (for documentary editions), and a section allowing to transform a TEI XML critical edition into LateX then PDF, through a graphical user interface:

The XSLT file offered in this repository is the one used for the TEI2LateX transformation. It aims at being as generic as possible for TEI critical editions using the parallel segmentation method.
